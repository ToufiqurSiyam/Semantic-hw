                <p>
                    Cats have an extraordinary ability to sense vibrations, detecting even the slightest movements in
                    their environment. Their flexible spine allows them to jump five times their body length. Also, cats
                    use their whiskers to measure space and detect objects. No wonder they're such agile hunters!

                    The domestic cat, Felis catus, is a small, typically furry, carnivorous mammal. They are often
                    called house cats when kept as indoor pets. Cats were first domesticated in the Near East around
                    7500 BCE. Their closest wild relatives are the African wildcat.
